pm-reddit-bot
===========

Reddit bot that sends default:10 posts from /r/subreddit/new to my username

Purpose
=======

Since I became a moderator I have found that I sometimes forget to login to my alt account and do some "moderating"
This will send my a weekly private message to my main account containing the top X newest posts that week. It is ran on a weekly cron job.
